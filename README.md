# election-campaign-dynamics

Political campaigns are important moments for political personalities, political parties, and their campaigners as well. During this period, arguments, ideas and topics flow between the candidates, and one can wonder how the discourse of a campaign is constructed. This way, one can understand the main campaign focus points, its key topics, their life-cycle and how they evolve during campaigns.
Political speeches, during campaign season are known for being formulaic and repetitive. What could we learn by looking for patterns in the way the speeches change over the course of the campaign? 
For this project, we are preparing to look at the campaign evolution of the 2022 France Presidential election candidates.
